# Hospital-Management-System

This repository contains the source code for a PHP and MySQL-based clinic/hospital management system developed as part of the COMP 351: Advanced Website Programming course at the University of the Fraser Valley. The system is designed to streamline administrative tasks and enhance patient care through efficient management functionalities.

## Abstract
The report presents the development and implementation of a PHP and MySQL-based clinic/hospital management system aimed at streamlining administrative tasks and improving patient care. The system encompasses user authentication, patient registration, appointment scheduling, medical record management, and administrative functionalities. Leveraging PHP for server-side scripting and MySQL for database management, the system ensures secure user access through session management and guards against common security threats like SQL injection. The user interface is designed for intuitive navigation, with screenshots provided to illustrate key pages. Testing methodologies are outlined, along with challenges faced during development and potential future enhancements. Overall, the project demonstrates the successful integration of technology to enhance healthcare administration and patient services.

## Introduction
This report details the creation and implementation of a PHP and MySQL-based clinic/hospital management system, aimed at optimizing healthcare administration and patient care. The system, initiated from the index.php page, streamlines user authentication via the user_login.php page, ensuring secure access to tailored functionalities for MANAGEMENT, RECEPTIONISTS, and DOCTORS.
 
Built upon PHP for dynamic scripting and MySQL for robust database management, the system offers a tailored experience for each user group. MANAGEMENT benefits from comprehensive administrative tools, while RECEPTIONISTS manage patient interactions efficiently, and DOCTORS access patient records seamlessly.
With a focus on security, the system employs stringent authentication measures and access controls to safeguard patient information. Continuous testing and refinement ensure data integrity, while user feedback guides future enhancements. Ultimately, this system aims to redefine healthcare administration, driving efficiency and elevating patient care standards.
